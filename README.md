This project was an early experiment in the development of [additive-cursor](https://nturge.github.io/additive-cursor/). Like the later site, this site uses javascript to create cursor elements on each mouse-click, tracking user mouse inputs to trail the orignal mouse. This site, however, is a little more glitchy, with sparatic movements of the mouse trail that become static again as the user stops moving the mouse. This project was made using https://netnet.studio and is live at [stagnant-additive-cursor](https://nturge.github.io/stagnant-additive-cursor-sketch/)
